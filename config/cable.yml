# Action Cable uses Redis by default to administer connections, channels, and sending/receiving messages over the WebSocket.
production:
  # adapter: redis
  # url: redis://localhost:6379/1
  adapter: async # Redis is needed for multiple processes, but for a single-process Heroku deployment async will actually work fine

development:
  adapter: async

test:
  adapter: async
